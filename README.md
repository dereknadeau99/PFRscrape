# PFRscape

A side project of mine, using R's webscraping packages to automatically gather large quantities of data from ProFootballReference's website, in order to easily analyze and visualize the data contained there in a way that would be very painstaking manually.

I hope to use R as a back-end to a web app GUI where a user can search for very broad or very specific information and the program will return the data and numerous graphs visualizing that data.
